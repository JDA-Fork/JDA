/**
 * Annotation used by events, specifying that a cached member is required for the event to fire for said member.
 *
 * <p>There are multiple ways a member/user would be cached,
 * the prerequisite being that the {@link MemberCachePolicy} needs to allow it to be cached first.
 * <br>Assuming the cache policy allows a member to be cached, the member will be loaded in the cache when either:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>JDA loads it on startup, using {@link ChunkingFilter}</li>
 *     <li>It is loaded explicitly, using {@link Guild#retrieveMemberById(long)} for example</li>
 *     <li>An event from the member is received, such as {@link SlashCommandInteractionEvent} for example</li>
 * </ul>
